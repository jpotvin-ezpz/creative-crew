Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo? https://puzzled-joke.surge.sh/
- What was your experience? This was rather difficult for me, I though I had CSS on lock but I struggled with positioning the text vertically on the side of the image cards. 
- What have you learned/improved?
 + Grid
 + Relative & Absolute Positioning
 + Responsive Layouts 
- Your wisdom? 
 + Take the time to read guides and don't just look for the quick code snippet.
